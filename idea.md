Title: Intelligent Crop Yield Prediction System

Farmers often make decisions about crop selection, irrigation, and fertilizer usage without accurate yield estimation. This leads to financial loss and inefficient resource utilization.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning based agricultural analytics system that predicts crop yield using historical farm, soil, and weather data.

The system will help farmers estimate production before harvesting so they can plan storage, pricing, and selling strategy.

Scope (Milestone-1):
- Predict crop yield using ML models
- Identify key factors affecting yield
- Provide results through a simple UI

Future Scope (Milestone-2):
- AI advisory assistant suggesting farming practices
